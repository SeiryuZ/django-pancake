Library for "flattening" Django templates.

Run "manage.py pancake" with an output directory name, and it will fill that
directory with a "flat" version of each template -- a pancake. A pancake is a
template in which:

* Template inheritance is fully expanded. {% extends %} and {% block %} tags
  are gone, and the parent templates are fully folded in.

* {% include %} and {% ssi %} tags are gone, with their contents fully folded
  in.

Pancakes behave exactly the same as the original templates. But they render
more quickly, because they avoid the overhead of template inheritance and
template includes at rendering time.

Think of it as "denormalizing" your templates, as a database administrator
might denormalize SQL tables for performance. You give up the DRY principle
but make up for it in faster application speed.

Obviously, pancakes are very redundant -- each of them includes all of the
markup from the base template(s), etc. You shouldn't check pancakes into
revision control or hand-edit them. They're purely for performance and should
be handled as any automatically generated code.

Usage
=====

1. Generate the pancakes:

    ./manage.py pancake /path/to/new/template/directory

2. Point Django at the pancake directory:

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = [
        '/path/to/new/template/directory',
    ]

3. Enjoy faster template performance.

Limitations
===========

* This will not work with templates that use dynamic {% extends %} tags. For
  example, a template containing this will not work:

      {% extends my_template_name %}

  It will only work with hard-coded parent template names, like this:

      {% extends "some_template.html" %}

Related projects
================

Ideally, django-pancake wouldn't exist, and Django would do this "flattening"
itself, along with providing a more robust template compilation step. That's a
significantly harder problem, and we're working on it. The goal is for
django-pancake not to have to exist.

But, in the meantime, here are some related projects that have gone down that
road:
